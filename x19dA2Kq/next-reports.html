                    content: `Kenya is entering the most consequential regulatory overhaul in its gambling history, and 2026 will be the year the industry resets. The Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB) has suspended all licence applications and has handed over its powers to the newly created Gambling Regulatory Authority of Kenya (GRA).\n\nA new law, the Gambling Control Act, has replaced decades-old rules with a streamlined, compliance-driven and consumer-focused regime. From stricter responsible gambling measures to real-time monitoring, unified national oversight and enhanced AML and data-protection benchmarks, the GRA will reset every operational, strategic and regulatory assumption in the market. The law also introduces B2B licensing, opening new opportunities for suppliers and service providers in the sector. What’s more, recent tax reforms have transformed Kenya’s gambling taxation from one of the most burdensome in the region to one of the most competitive.\n\nThis 2026 report will unpack what the transition means for operators, suppliers, investors and policymakers. With licensing suspended until at least February 2026 and the GRA set to define entirely new standards, all stakeholders face a period of uncertainty but also opportunity. The report will analyse the shift, map the new regulatory architecture, track market disruptions, and outline critical timelines that will shape business decisions throughout 2026 and beyond.`

                    content: `Brazil’s first year as a regulated gambling market has been anything but quiet. As the industry accelerates, rumblings are growing that the regulator is preparing to move from licensing to strict enforcement, with substantial fines expected for operators that fall short of their obligations.\n\nOver the past 12 months, operators have navigated sweeping regulatory shifts, including new tax measures that are reshaping competition. Market moves are already underway: everyone outside the top 10 is reportedly exploring a sale. Consolidation attempts are plentiful, but experts caution it may take another year before any major deals land. And the current top three? Few believe they’ll still be top of the table in five years.\n\nBut rapid expansion brings its own risks. Legal experts warn that Brazil may be entering the perfect storm for consumer litigation. If 2025 was the year the market found its footing, 2026 will be defined by the consolidation and growth now being set in motion. This report delivers the data, analysis, and expert insight you need to stay ahead in one of the world’s most dynamic new gambling markets.`

                    content: `A little over a year after a federal court struck down the US ban on election betting, prediction markets have surged from niche curiosity to billion-dollar battlegrounds.\n\nThe commercial potential is now undeniable. Kalshi’s valuation has surpassed $11bn, Polymarket is posting record on-chain volumes, and major gambling operators are moving in. FanDuel and DraftKings—the two leaders in US sports betting—are preparing to launch their own prediction-market products in the coming weeks. They join a growing cohort of daily fantasy sports (DFS) and sports gaming brands that now view prediction markets as the next major product category, capable of attracting both traditional bettors and a younger, data-driven audience.\n\nThis report traces the evolution of prediction markets from centuries-old betting traditions to the modern crypto era, outlines the emerging competitive landscape, and examines the regulatory and investment forces driving their rapid rise. It considers the risks of manipulation and fragmented oversight, but also highlights the industry’s biggest opportunity: building a new high-engagement product category that could eventually rival traditional sportsbook and gaming revenue streams.`

                    content: `Fewer operators, more control? Could Italy’s new rules be the secret formula for a sustainable market?\n\nItaly’s gambling industry has always carried a hint of intrigue, from its deep cultural roots to the shadows of mafia influence that linger over parts of the sector. Yet in 2025, the stakes changed. A redesigned online licensing system slashed the number of operators, turning a once-crowded market into a tightly controlled playground for the few who could pay the price.\n\nThis report dives into that transformation. Behind the headlines of soaring revenue and headline-grabbing mergers lies a carefully managed reshuffle: licensing costs, high-profile mergers, and an intensified battle against the black market are reshaping the landscape. But as Italy tightens its grip on the industry, the question remains: can this new era balance growth, integrity, and competition, and maybe even become a model for Europe’s gambling future?`

                    content: `South Africa, the continent’s largest and most lucrative gambling market, is once again under the spotlight. The National Treasury has floated a bold 20% tax on gross gambling revenue, covering everything from sports betting to the country’s still-murky online casino sector. If adopted, this levy would stack on top of VAT, provincial taxes, and corporate income tax, pushing the total burden toward a staggering 44% of GGR — potentially the highest effective rate anywhere in the world.\n\nAmid mounting pressure, lawmakers are still wrestling with the unresolved illegality of online gambling. While some provincial regulators license traditional casino games under current sports betting regulations, the Democratic Alliance attempted to break the deadlock with fresh legislation in 2024, but momentum has since stalled.\n\nThis report dives deep into South Africa’s fast-evolving gambling landscape: market growth, regulatory gridlock, competitive shifts, and the rise of online play. It also unpacks the financial and operational impact of the proposed national tax — and what it could mean for operators, consumers, and government coffers alike.`

                    content: `Finland is gearing up for the most significant overhaul of its gambling sector in decades, as the country shifts from a long-standing state monopoly to a fully regulated, competitive licensing model. With the Finnish Parliament’s Administrative Committee finalising its report — and the legislation expected to pass without further changes — the framework for a modernised market is quickly crystallising.\n\nThe reform sets out a clear transition timeline that operators and suppliers should already be preparing for. B2C licence applications will open on 1 March 2026, ahead of the market’s full launch on 1 July 2027. On the same date, B2B licence applications will become available, with the B2B licensing requirement coming into force a year later on 1 July 2028.\n\nThis report examines Finland’s transition from monopoly to licensing, analysing the regulatory roadmap, commercial opportunities, competitive dynamics, and the emerging vision shaping the country’s next chapter.`

                    content: `Despite a population of 120 million, twice that of Kenya, Ethiopia hosts only a limited number of established operators, making it one of Africa’s most intriguing and underdeveloped gambling opportunities. International brands are already present, despite the 100% local-ownership requirement, operating through franchise and service-agreement models that allow them to build a footprint without holding the licence directly.\n\nBut Ethiopia comes with real structural challenges: retail operations remain banned, repatriating profits is notoriously difficult, and the regulatory environment demands patience as well as creativity. Local betting behaviour is consistent with broader African trends: strong appetite for crash games and high-multiple accumulator bets.\n\nOur upcoming Ethiopia Report breaks down the regulatory model, market entry pathways, player preferences, competitive dynamics, and the realistic opportunities for growth. This is a market to watch.`

New titles keep emerging, and the reality is that iGaming executives are navigating a landscape far more dynamic and multifaceted than ever before.\n\nThis report explores how today’s iGaming companies are reshaping their leadership teams, what skills are now critical at the top, and what the next wave of C-suite evolution might look like.`

Officially, the market is not yet regulated, yet full-scale gambling platforms are quietly appearing, leaving the industry guessing. Some see the spark of innovation, with hints of crypto, blockchain, and high-tech platforms testing the waters.\n\nWith each emirate allowed just one licence, early moves by suppliers suggest the UAE is experimenting with a futuristic, transparent gaming ecosystem, but the rules of the game are still being written. For investors and operators, it’s a market of possibility, where innovation meets ambiguity, and the first movers could shape the landscape of Middle Eastern gaming for years to come.\n\nWe planned this report for Q4 2026, anticipating that by then more clarity would have emerged on licensing, regulation, and market development.`
